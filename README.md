# bitcoin-stark-verifier

A STARK verifier in Bitcoin Script, using **no `OP_CAT`** and no other disabled
opcode.

| Crate | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| [`poseidon2`](poseidon2/) | Poseidon2 over KoalaBear — the permutation, the degree-4 extension field, row hashing and Merkle path verification |
| [`whir`](whir/) | The WHIR verifier on top of it — Fiat–Shamir sponge, challenger, sumcheck rounds, multilinear evaluation, query openings, constraint batching and the closing identity |

📄 **[Algorithm and implementation review](docs/whir-review.pdf)** — a formal
account of the STIR and WHIR proximity tests, what this implementation checks,
what it does not, and why. Source: [`docs/whir-review.tex`](docs/whir-review.tex).

```
cargo test                              # everything, 98 tests
cargo test -p whir --test end_to_end    # a real Plonky3 proof, in script
cargo test -p whir --test budget        # what it would cost on-chain
```

## Why no `OP_CAT`

`OP_SHA256` hashes one stack item, while a Merkle step hashes two children
concatenated — so a byte hash needs `OP_CAT`, which is disabled, and re-enabling
it means a soft fork ([BIP-347](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0347.mediawiki)
is `Complete` but not deployed).

An **algebraic** hash removes the dependency. A Poseidon2 digest is eight field
elements rather than thirty-two bytes, so compressing two children hands sixteen
field elements to a width-16 permutation — sixteen stack items passed to an
arithmetic routine, with nothing to concatenate. It is also the hash
[Ziren](https://github.com/ProjectZKM/Ziren) commits with.

## What the verifier does

`verifier::verify_and_close` emits the whole schedule and ends on the identity
the protocol exists to reach:

```
claimed_eval == w(R) · f_M(r_fin)
```

Every value in it is derived inside the script. `R` is each round's folding
randomness, accumulated by the sumcheck rounds rather than discarded; `w(R)` is
the accumulated constraints evaluated at `R`; `f_M` is a copy the absorb kept of
the final polynomial, and `r_fin` is the tail of `R`.

Per round the schedule absorbs the commitment, alternates out-of-domain samples
with their answers, opens the round's queries against the **previous** round's
commitment, and runs its sumcheck rounds. Query indices are squeezed from the
sponge, and the index *is* the Merkle path: the spender picks neither which leaf
is opened nor where it sits.

### What is checked

- **Challenges are unchooseable.** Every one is squeezed after the values it
  depends on are absorbed. Supplying them instead is not a shortcut but a
  soundness error of exactly one — the review works out why.
- **An opening is one unit.** The row is bound to its leaf by
  `merkle::hash_row` (Plonky3's `PaddingFreeSponge`, checked against it on a row
  from a real proof), the path recomputes the root, and that root is the
  **absorbed commitment** rather than a value taken from the witness.
- **The closing identity is real.** All four extension coefficients, against a
  claim the transcript produced.

- **The constraints are derived, not supplied.** Each round buries the
  out-of-domain scalars it samples, the shift points its queries produce
  (`domain_gen^index`) and its batching challenge below the folding randomness;
  the closing check lifts them back out and evaluates the whole weight
  polynomial from them. A round costs `1 + n` extension elements to carry rather
  than `n · (1 + arity)`, because its constraints share a challenge and each
  point is the square-power expansion of one scalar.

### What is not

The **statement** is supplied, and always will be: its point is public because
it *is* the claim being proved, and a different point is a different statement
rather than a cheaper proof of the same one.

Two fidelity items remain against Plonky3. Each constraint group ends with a
fresh squeeze for its batching challenge rather than reading whichever rate slot
the query indices happened to leave — one permutation per round, traded for not
coupling the challenge's position to the query count. And Plonky3 folds the
statement and the commit phase's out-of-domain samples into one
`initial_constraint` with a shared challenge, where this treats them as two
groups.


## End to end

`whir/tests/end_to_end.rs` runs [Plonky3](https://github.com/Plonky3/Plonky3)'s
actual WHIR prover over KoalaBear, verifies the proof with **Plonky3's own
verifier**, then re-derives the same claims in Bitcoin Script and executes it.

The native verification comes first on purpose. Every other test compares a
script against a Rust reference, which establishes that the two agree — not that
either is right. Where a primitive exists in Plonky3, it is checked against
Plonky3 directly: `eq_eval` against `Point::eval_eq`, `expand_univariate`
against `Point::expand_from_univariate`, the leaf hash against
`PaddingFreeSponge`.

No hand-built vectors are involved. Perturbing any evaluation moves the squeezed
challenge, which moves the chained claim, which breaks the closing identity —
asserted for every evaluation in the proof.

## Measured cost

Everything follows from one constant: a Poseidon2 permutation is **572,228
bytes**, and nothing else is within 1% of it. Each figure below is the length of
a script some test executes.

| | bytes |
| --- | ---: |
| one Poseidon2 permutation | 572,228 |
| one Merkle level | 572,252 *(24 bytes of ordering overhead)* |
| Merkle path at depth 21 | 12,017,292 — **3.0 blocks** |
| `sumcheck_round()` | 95,100 |
| `sumcheck_round_fs()` | 667,539 |
| …keeping its challenge for the closing check | 667,615 — **+76 B, 0.011%** |
| `eval_multilinear(4)` | 358,048 |
| `eq_eval(4)` | 190,780 |
| `constraint_eval`, 10 constraints of arity 8 | 4,053,279 |
| …derived from scalars instead | 5,687,109 — **+40%** |
| the whole closing check, example config | 92,801,911 — **7.5%, 0 permutations** |
| **composed sumcheck chain, one real proof** | **8,967,342** |

For the 2²⁰ example configuration — 20 queries, folding factor 4 —
`whir/tests/verifier.rs` reports:

| | permutations |
| --- | ---: |
| Merkle paths | 1,300 |
| leaf hashing | 800 |
| transcript | 62 |
| **total** | **2,162** = 1.24 GB = **309.3 blocks** |
| **query share** | **97.1%** |

Leaf hashing is 37% of that on its own: a row at folding factor 4 is sixteen
extension elements, so sixty-four base elements, so eight permutations per query
on top of the twenty-one the path costs. It buys the binding — without it a
spender could authenticate the committed leaf and fold a different row.

The closing identity is **92,801,911 bytes — 7.5% of the verifier, and no
permutation at all**, evaluating 110 constraints derived from the transcript.
Against a supplied list it is 1.5 MB; deriving is what stops a spender choosing
them. Arithmetic is the cheap part without being a free one.

## Does it fit in a transaction?

No, and the wall is lower than a query. Taproot removed the 10,000-byte script
limit and the 201-opcode cap, so what binds is weight: 400,000 units for a
standard transaction, 4,000,000 for a block, witness bytes counting one each.

**A standard transaction holds 0.70 of a single permutation.** One *hash* does
not fit, let alone one query — which is 3.4 to 4.6 blocks across every
configuration `whir/tests/budget.rs` derives.

Lowering the security level does not change that. It buys **fewer queries, not
cheaper ones**: at 16 variables a query costs the same 13.7 MB at 80 and 100
bits, because depth is set by the domain size and not by λ. What moves is the
total:

| λ | pow | vars | permutations | blocks |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 100 | 22 | 16 | 976 | 139.6 |
| 80 | 22 | 16 | 740 | **105.9** |
| 80 | 22 | 20 | 991 | 141.8 |
| 80 | 22 | 24 | 1,249 | 178.7 |

Chunking is therefore not optional, and its unit has to be *sub-query*.

## Chunks

The verifier is never executed on-chain. What can be is one **step** of it, if
the prover commits to the state between steps and a challenger names the step it
claims is wrong — so what matters is the step count and whether a step relays.

A step cannot be one Merkle level (572,252 bytes against 400,000 weight units),
so it has to be sub-permutation. That is less awkward than it sounds: a
permutation is already a chain of rounds, each taking a state and leaving a
state, and `permutation::rounds()` emits them with a test pinning their
composition to `permute()`.

| | |
| --- | ---: |
| rounds per permutation | 29 |
| largest step | **50,126 B — 12.5% of a standard transaction** |
| steps per standard transaction | 7 |
| the whole verifier, 80-bit, 20 vars | 28,855 steps ≈ **4,100 chunks** |

Four thousand chunks is the same order as BitVM2's own leaf count, which is the
first evidence here that the approach is viable rather than merely smaller.
`cargo test -p whir --test budget` prints the table for other configurations,
and `poseidon2::disprove` holds the per-step predicate.

**What the count leaves out.** There is no commitment layer — what stops a
prover answering one challenge with one state and another with a different one
is a one-time signature over each committed value, which needs only single-item
hashing and so no soft fork, but is not here. And the arithmetic between
permutations does not decompose: 2% of the verifier, which is still 25 MB with
no step boundaries in it, and so not counted in the 4,100.


## Security parameters

`pow_bits: 0` is not a conservative choice; it is a configuration that mostly
does not exist. Neither security level is derivable past a toy instance without
grinding: 100-bit at 16 variables already requires 19 bits, 20 variables
requires 28, and 24 requires 37. Even 80-bit needs 8 bits at 20 variables.
KoalaBear gives log₂(p) = 30.989 and degree 4, so 123.955 bits are available and
the field is never what binds.

The soundness regime is `SecurityAssumption::CapacityBound`, the cheapest of the
three by a factor of 3.7 in verifier hashes — here, directly, in script bytes —
and the only one resting on the unproven half of WHIR's Conjecture 4.12. A
verifier that settles bitcoin should say out loud which assumption it stands on.

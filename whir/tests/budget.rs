//! Does a WHIR verifier fit in a Bitcoin transaction?
//!
//! Everything else in this crate measures a script. This asks the question the
//! measurements exist to answer, against a real `WhirConfig` derived by Plonky3
//! rather than a schedule written out by hand -- so the query counts, domain
//! sizes and folding schedule are whatever the security analysis actually
//! produces at a given level.
//!
//! Two limits bind, and neither is the one people expect. Taproot removed both
//! the 10 000-byte script limit and the 201-opcode cap, so what is left is
//! weight: a standard transaction is capped at 400 000 weight units, and a
//! block at 4 000 000. Script lives in the witness at one unit per byte.

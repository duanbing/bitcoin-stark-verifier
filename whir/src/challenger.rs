//! Drawing challenges from the sponge, in Bitcoin Script.
//!
//! WHIR needs two kinds: field elements, which are rate slots taken as they
//! are, and query indices, which are `sample_bits` — a rate slot masked to the
//! log of the domain size.
//!
//! Plonky3's `sample` pops a buffered rate slot and re-duplexes when the buffer
//! empties. A script does not need that bookkeeping: the verifier's absorb and
//! squeeze schedule is fixed when the script is built, so which rate slot a
//! given challenge comes from is known at generation time and is a parameter
//! here rather than runtime state.

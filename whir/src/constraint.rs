//! Batching a round's answers into the next target, in Bitcoin Script.
//!
//! A WHIR round ends by folding its out-of-domain answer and its `t` shift
//! answers into the *next* round's constraint. Following the paper's §2.1.3:
//!
//! ```text
//! w'(Z, X) := w(Z, alpha, X) + Z * sum_{i=0}^{t} gamma^(i+1) * eq(z_i, X)
//! sigma'   := h_k(alpha_k)   +     sum_{i=0}^{t} gamma^(i+1) * y_i
//! ```
//!
//! The two halves are not equally hard. `sigma'` is plain extension-field
//! arithmetic on values the verifier already holds, and that is what
//! [`combine_answers`] computes. `w'` is carried *symbolically* — it is never
//! evaluated during a round — and the question is what happens to it at the end.
//!
//! # Two readings of the closing identity, and which one Plonky3 uses
//!
//! The paper's reading folds the weight against the polynomial's evaluations:
//!
//! ```text
//! sum_b f_M(b) * gamma^e * eq(z, b)  =  gamma^e * f_M(z)
//! ```
//!
//! so each accumulated term collapses into an evaluation of `f_M` and no `eq`
//! is ever computed. That is what [`closing_check`] does, and an earlier version
//! of this module claimed it was the whole story.
//!
//! It is not the shape Plonky3's verifier has. There, `w` and `f_M` are kept
//! apart and each is evaluated at its own point:
//!
//! ```text
//! claimed_eval == evaluation_of_weights * final_value
//!     evaluation_of_weights = eval_constraints_poly(&constraints, &folding_randomness)
//!     final_value           = final_evaluations.eval_ext(&final_sumcheck_randomness)
//! ```
//!
//! and `eval_constraints_poly` evaluates every accumulated `eq(z, .)` explicitly.
//! Since this crate is checked against Plonky3, that is the shape the script has
//! to produce, and it needs an `eq` primitive after all — [`eq_eval`].
//!
//! # Threading, and why it needs no per-round work
//!
//! The natural guess is that a carried pair has to be rewritten every round, its
//! weight picking up a factor as the sumcheck binds variables. It does not. The
//! constraints are simply *accumulated*, and at the end each is evaluated
//! against the concatenation of every round's folding randomness:
//!
//! ```text
//! R = alpha^(0) || alpha^(1) || ... || alpha^(final)
//! ```
//!
//! A constraint created at round `i` is over `n_c` variables, and the randomness
//! that binds those variables is everything from round `i` onwards — the **last
//! `n_c` coordinates of `R`**. That is exactly `get_subpoint_over_range(..n_c)`
//! on the reversed point, reversed back.
//!
//! On a stack this rule costs nothing to implement. Push `R` with `R[0]` deepest
//! and the last `n_c` coordinates are the *topmost* `n_c` elements, so every
//! constraint reads from the top and a longer one simply reaches further down.
//! No slicing, no arithmetic on offsets, and no per-round rewriting: see
//! [`constraint_eval`].
//!
//! Together with the row-to-leaf binding in [`poseidon2::merkle::hash_row`] and
//! [`combine_answers`], this is what makes a query *constrain* something. Before,
//! an answer was authenticated against the commitment and then dropped; now it
//! reaches the claim, and the claim reaches the closing identity.
